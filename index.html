            A story of an Argentine plumber who immigrated to the US escaping from a turbulent country, Argentina in the 80s with military governments, looking for the American dream, and suddenly gets involved in a case of police brutality, human rights leaders, the media pressure who took advantage of him, court rooms, millionaire demands, unfaithful lawyers and covered settlements.
            <br><br>
            <mark><b>After KTLA and CNN aired the video television stations around the world quickly picked it up</b></mark> "My phone blew up. Everybody wanted to interview me and get a copy of the tape". There was a sea of reporters every day, George recalled. My wife Maria didn't even want to leave the house. He may have pioneered citizen journalism,but he was swallowed up and spit out by CNN, gave him little credit and no compensation for his contribution to history. </p>

            <p class="textLeft w-80 quote"> <mark><b> Without a doubt, this accidental citizen journalist was exploited by CNN and the rest of the media</b></mark>
            The Los Angeles riots were modern America's deadliest, with 53 killed. Damages exceeded $1 billion. Coming as they did in the spring of 1992, the riots derailed Bush's re-election campaign and boosted Bill Clinton's election efforts. As a result, one could say that George Holliday may have ended one presidency, launched another, and helped ensure that today's leading Democratic contender, Hillary Clinton, would have an eight-year head start to her political career. Not bad for plumber using his new toy.</p>

            <img class="w-80" src="./img/Screen-Shot-2020-06-24-at-13-46-48.jpg" alt=" foto peridista con paraguas"/>

            <p class="textLeft w-80 quote"> <mark><b>¨People have blamed me for the disturbances. What is on the tape caused them, not the tape¨</b></mark>
            <b>You are the guy who caused the riots.</b> George received death threats and was constantly hounded by the media "Be careful when you start your car.
            <br><br>
            <mark><b>Rodney King wins a $3.8 Million settlement from the City of Los Angeles</b></mark>
            However, one person later thanked him. In late 1991 Holliday stopped at a gas station and a young black man in a new sports car pulled up at the same pump:<b> "Hey, George Holliday,</b>" the man said. "You do not recognize me, do you?" Suddenly, he realized it was Rodney King.<b> "I just wanted to thank you. You saved my life."</b> They shook hands and said goodbye.
            <br><br>
            The images of the Rodney King Beating Video were seared into the American consciousness: A black man struggling on the ground while Los Angeles police officers stood in a semicircle around savagely kicking and shocking him with an electric stun gun, landing 56 baton blows to his body, battering and bloodying him. Black leaders rallied behind Rodney King immediately. They say,
            <b>"Seeing the Rodney King beating was like seeing history repeated again and again."</b></p>

            <img class="w-80" src="./img/Screen-Shot-2020-06-24 at-14-05-47.jpg" alt="fotos policias golpeadores"/>

            <p class="textLeft w-80 quote"> <mark><b>The influence of the video in the American society</mark></b><br>
            A prosecutor who was absolutely convinced that it was an open-and-shut case based on the George Holliday video, which showed King being beaten by the police. Little did he realize that by re-editing the images, the attorneys defending the L.A. police officers, in the first criminal case, totally changed the story. Ever since, the beating of Rodney King and the ensuing riots have formed a somber backdrop to America's "dialogue" on race. The beating itself, and the initial exoneration of LAPD officers by a suburban Simi Valley jury, supported the notion that America remained a deeply racist society.
    
            </p>

            <p class="textLeft w-80 quote"><mark><b>Movies, music, TV</b></mark><br>
            The powerful echoes of which we see on display in American TV and Cinema which uses actual footage from the King video such as: <b>Natural Born Killers, Strange Days, Mace, Malcom-X, Dark Blue, Straight Outta Compton, Wu-Tang: An American Saga, and the American Crime Story/O.J. Simpson Trial,</b>¨Fox producers decided to open with the Rodney King beating and the 1992 Los Angeles riots, laying the groundwork for Mr. Simpson's defense in a trial that largely served as a referendum on the Los Angeles Police Department treatment of blacks.¨ as NY Times states in its article. The verdict exonerating him was clearly marked by the King beating and the riots in a context of racial tensions and mistrust of police. Today the Rodney King Beating Video is still remaining as an unique reference.
            <br><br>
            <mark><b>Politics</b></mark><br>
            The Riots occurred just four days after Operation Desert Storm had ended triumphantly. With a 90 percent approval rating in the polls, <b>President George H.W. Bush</b> expected an easy re-election in 1992. Rodney King emerged as a great American healer, demonstrating more effective leadership than President Bush during the rioting by pleading:<b> People, I want to say, can we all get along?</b>
            <br><br>            
            <mark><b>Educational</b></mark>
            Rodney King Beating Video is a continuous matter of study in most schools and universities of the U.S. It turned what would otherwise have been a violent, but soon forgotten, encounter between Los Angeles police and Rodney King into one of the most widely watched and discussed incidents of its kind.

              <p><b>Repeated viewings of those images created within the American subconscious a particular code for the representation of racial conflict.</b><br><br>
              The Holliday tape is shown so often on world wide television that one CNN executive calls it "wallpaper." It is a continuous matter of study in most schools and universities of the  U.S.<br><br>
              A dramatic encounter with a stranger and the Los Angeles police. Rodney King was pulled over by the police in Los Angeles, had an angry verbal confrontation with the officers, and was then brutally assaulted by several of them. Public servants gone wildly out of control, savagely kicked King, landed 56 baton blows to his body, battering and bloodying him. The beating was so loud and raucous, in fact, that it caught the attention of George Holliday in his nearby apartment. He got out of his bed and went to his window, where he witnessed the horrible scene. Holliday immediately went to get his video camera, and he captured the whole awful episode on tape.
            <br><br>
            Holliday reflects on how he did not realize how newsworthy his video of the Rodney King beating would be. He explains, "Coming from Argentina, it's different over there.  If a criminal commits a crime, you know, the police take him in and they take care of him.  For me, that's normal because that's the way I grew up." But Holliday was curious about what he had witnessed, so when the L.A. police would give him no details, he called local television station KTLA. Those videotaped images rocked this nation's consciousness.

                <p><b>The images of the Rodney King Beating Video were seared into the American consciousness: a black man struggling on the ground while Los Angeles police officers stood in a semicircle around him, beating him for 19 brutal seconds. Black leaders rallied behind Rodney King immediately. They say, "Seeing the Rodney King beating was, like, seeing history repeated again and again."</b>
                <br><br>   
                A prosecutor who was absolutely convinced that it was an open-and-shut case based on the George Holliday video, which showed King being beaten by the police. Little did he realize that by re-editing the images, the attorneys defending the L.A. police officers, in the first criminal case, totally changed the story. One year later, in the same city, different images: angry fists and faces, broken glass and flames, 54 dead, 2,000 injured and a city tearing itself apart before the world. Ever since, the beating of Rodney King and the ensuing riots have formed a somber backdrop to America's "dialogue" on race. The beating itself, and the initial exoneration of LAPD officers by a suburban Simi Valley jury, supported the notion that America remained a deeply racist society. Today the Rodney King Beating Video is still remaining as an unique reference.<br><br>
                The powerful echoes of which we see on display in American cinema as Natural Born Killers (which uses actual footage from the King video), The People v. O.J Simpson: American Crime Story, Straight Outta Compton, Strange Days, Mace, Malcom-X, Dark Blue, and The Matrix Reloaded, in which the beating of the main character "Morpheus" seeks to draw upon its audience's familiarity with the Rodney King beating. the codes inherent to the historical representation of racial conflict. <br><br>
                Due to a recent ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Chief Justice stated in her dissent that, had the King incident occurred in Massachusetts, "...under today's ruling Holliday would have been exposed to criminal indictment rather than lauded for exposing an injustice."
